Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone  \n \nCHAPTER ONE  \nTHE BOY WHO LIVED  \n \nMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say \nthat they were  perfectly  normal,  thank  you very much.  They  were  the last \npeople you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, \nbecause they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.  \n \nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made \ndrills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did \nhave a very large mustache. Mrs. Du rsley was thin and blonde and had \nnearly  twice  the usual  amount  of neck,  which  came  in very useful  as she \nspent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the \nneighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their \nopinion there w as no finer boy anywhere.  \n \nThe Dursleys  had everything  they wanted,  but they also had a secret,  and \ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t  \nthink they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. \nPotter was Mrs. Du rsley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; \nin fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her \nsister  and her good -for-nothing  husband  were  as unDursleyish  as it was \npossible  to be.
